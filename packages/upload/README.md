import Upload from '@availity/upload';

<Upload clientId="a" bucketId="b" customerId="c" />;

### `onFileUpload?: (upload: UploadCore) => void`

Callback called when file is uploaded. The callback is provided the `Upload` instance from upload-core SDK. Use this callback to track which files have been uploaded (to get references returned by the API).

### `onFileRemove?: (files: Array<File>, fileId: String) => void`

### Example
