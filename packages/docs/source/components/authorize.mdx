[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@availity/authorize.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@availity/authorize)

## Installation

```bash
npm install @availity/authorize @availity/api-axios @availity/api-core axios --save
```

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Authorize from '@availity/authorize';

<Authorize permissions="1234">
  {/* stuff to render if the user is authorized with permission indicated above */}
</Authorize>;
```

## Props

### `permissions: string | number | Array<string | number`>`

Can either be a string, eg: `"1234"`, a number, eg: `1234`, or an array, which can contain permission ID strings as well as other arrays which contain permission ID strings/numbers, eg: `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]`. The items in a nested array indicate permission IDs that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if _any_ are granted, the user is considered authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` is similar to `'1234' OR '2345' OR ('3456' && '4567') OR ('5678' && '6789')`.

### `loader?: boolean | ReactNode`

When `true`, `BlockUi` is used when loading the permissions. When a `node`, that node is rendered instead of `BlockUi` when loading the permissions. When `false`, nothing is rendered when loading the permissions. **Default:** `true`.

### `organizationId?: string`

When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.

### `customerId?: string`

When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the customer. Note: Cannot be used in combination with the `organizationId` prop.

### `region?: string | boolean`

When a string, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the provided region. When true, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the current region. **Default:** `true`.

### `unauthorized?: ReactNode`
The content that renders when the user _does not_ have the permissions required.

### `children: ReactNode`
The content that renders when the user _does_ have the permissions required.

### `negate?: boolean`
Negate the authorization. If the user _does_ have the permissions specified, they are considered "unauthorized" (shown the `unauthorized` prop content). If the user _does not_ have the permissions specified, they are considered "authorized" (shown the `children` prop content)


## useAuthorize

Hook which validates the user's permissions and returns whether the user is authorized.

The items in a nested array indicate permission IDs that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if _any_ are granted to the user, the user is considered authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` is similar to `'1234' || '2345' || ('3456' && '4567') || ('5678' && '6789')`.
- **`options`** Object. Optional. Additional options
  - **`organizationId`**: String. Optional. When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.
