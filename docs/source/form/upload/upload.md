title: <Upload /> ( Default Export )
---

The default export is an all-in-one solution which handles uploads, encrypted file password requests and file state management for you.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Upload from '@availity/form-upload';
import { Form } from '@availity/form';

<Form initialValues={{ myFile: undefined }}>
  <Upload name="myFile" clientId="a" bucketId="b" customerId="c" />;
</Form>
```

## Props

### `name: string`

Identifies the field and matches the validation schema.

### `btnText?: ReactNode`

`+ Add File` for initial file or `+ Add Another File Attachment` if an attachment already have been selected. | The text that appears on the button.

### `bucketId: string`

The ID of the bucket you want to upload to.

### `customerId: string`

### `onFileUpload?: (upload: UploadCore) => void`

Callback called when file is uploaded. The callback is provided the `Upload` instance from upload-core SDK. Use this callback to track which files have been uploaded (to get references returned by the API).

### `onFileRemove?: (files: Array<File>, fileId: String) => void`

### `disabled?: boolean`

### `showFileDrop?: boolean`

    name="myFile"
    btnText="Upload a claim"
    clientId="a"
    bucketId="b"
    customerId="c"
    onFileUpload={onUpload} // <-- add file callback function
    onFileRemove={onRemove} // <-- remove file callback function
    max={1}
  />
</Form>

// onUpload callback definition
onUpload(upload) {
    if (upload) {
      upload.onSuccess.push(async () => {
        // success action
      });
      upload.onError.push(() => {
        // error action
      });
    }
  }
