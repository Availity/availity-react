## Usage and Behavior

### Default Links

Links are used to help users take action or navigate throughout our various applications. The Availity link component 
follows a uniform design to meet 508 compliance. 

<div class="disclaimer">
 Do not style links differently from the basic Availity standard. Links cannot change colors, and underlines 
 cannot be removed. If you have a need or request to change a link color or style speak with a member of the 
 Availity user experience team. 
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
import AvLink from '@availity/link';

<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
  <AvLink href="/public/apps/my-app" target="newBody">
    Custom Link Text
  </AvLink>
</div>
```
