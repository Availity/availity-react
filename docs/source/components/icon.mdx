## Usage and Behavior

### Default Icon

Use icons sparingly, they should be used only when nessesary to draw extra attention or when additional
information can be conveyed to the user through symbolism. 

<div class="disclaimer">
 Do not use icons for everything. Do not use icons in your navigation if you can help it. 
 If you have additional questions speak with a member of the Availity user experience team.
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
import Icon from '@availity/icon';

<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
  <Icon name="home" size="3x" />
</div>
```

### Icon sizes

Icons can leverage many sizes; generally speaking, we try to keep interface icons down in the "lg" to "xl" range
as we tend to use them alongside labels. Rarely are icons used away from labels but when they are used 
decoratively there are a series of sizes that can be called to fit the desired presentation. 

<div class="disclaimer">
 Do not use large icons to draw attention to interface elements that are grouped together. Do not leverage size classes 
 that are inappropriate for their use case; too small or too big. If you have additional questions speak with a member of the Availity user experience team.
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
import Icon from '@availity/icon';

<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
    <Icon name="home" size="lg" />
    <Icon name="home" size="xl" />
    <Icon name="home" size="2x" />
    <Icon name="home" size="3x" />
    <Icon name="home" size="4x" />
    <Icon name="home" size="5x" />
</div>
```

### Icon colors

Icons can make use of our base class names used throughout our ui kit; see the buttons component for the
complete listing of classes. Icons are primary black with the exception of a few colors. 

- Primary blue when paired with links
- White when used on primary buttons
- Success green when paired with success responses
- Danger red when paired with only some delete actions

<div class="disclaimer">
  Do not change icon colors to differentiate between different interface elements loosely. The colors have meaning
  throughout the portal and across various component types. Do not change any of the default color values.
  Do not stray away from the supplied class names. 
  If you have additional questions speak with a member of the Availity user experience team.
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
import Icon from '@availity/icon';

<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
  <Icon name="home" size="3x" color="primary" />
  <Icon name="home" size="3x" color="default" />
  <Icon name="home" size="3x" color="danger" />
  <Icon name="home" size="3x" color="success" />
</div>
```
