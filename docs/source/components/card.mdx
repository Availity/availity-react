title: Card
---

Cards are used to help group like information and actions. They are used as stand-alone interface elements
and result cards alike.

## Implementation 

### Installation

This component comes natively with Availity reactstrap. 

### Example

```jsx live=true viewCode=true
<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
    <div class="card">
        <img class="card-img-top" src="https://via.placeholder.com/550x150?text=Image" alt="Card image cap" />
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
            <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            This is some text within a card body.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Card with links

Cards can be used as large touch targets themselves or they can contain additional actions related to their
content. 

<div class="disclaimer">
 Do not create actions inside of cards that are clickable. Do not put more than 3 actions in a card. 
 If you have additional questions speak with a member of the Availity user experience team.
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
            <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
            <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Card with images

Images can be used to help draw attention to related content. We do not use these cards in the portal today
but we leave them open as a potential future use case.

<div class="disclaimer">
 Do not use these today without first consulting a member of the Availity user experience team.
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
    <div class="card">
        <img class="card-img-top" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x100?text=Image" alt="Card image cap" />
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
            <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Card with header

Headers can be helpful by providing a space for a label regarding the information grouped within the card.

<div class="disclaimer">
 Do not put full sentences in the header. They are expected to be used as short simple labels or action containers.
 Do not put any action other than close/cancel/delete in a card header. 
 If you have additional questions speak with a member of the Availity user experience team.
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">
            Featured
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Special title treatment</h5>
            <p class="card-text">With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.</p>
            <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Card with footer

Footers are rarely used on cards; today they are only used to denote date/time of the information within
the card itself. If you have an additional use case please speak to a member to the user experience team.
