## Usage and Behavior

### Types of App Icons

Availity makes use of two types of app icons; solid and outline. A solid app icon is used 
when the application is located within the Availity portal; an Availity product.
Outlined app icons are used when the icon is used in junction with an application that is 
developed and managed outside of Availity by one of our partners. 

<div class="disclaimer">
  Do not use outlined icons to represent internal applications and vice versa do not use solid icons to
  represent external applications. 
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
import AppIcon from '@availity/app-icon';

<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">
  <AppIcon title="Payer Space" color="blue" size="lg">
  AV
</AppIcon>
<AppIcon title="Payer Space" color="blue" branded size="lg">
  AV
</AppIcon>
</div>
```


### Sizes of App Icons

App icons come in three sizes default, large, and extra-large. Default icons are used when representing 
your application in a search result, navigation menu, or application listing such as a dashboard view where
other applications may be listed. Large icons are not currently being used but are reserved for future potential.
Extra-large icons are used when the icon itself requires more affordance such as the tiles for my top applications
on the portal homepage. 

<div class="disclaimer">
  Do not modify the use cases presented above.
</div>

```jsx live=true viewCode=false
import AppIcon from '@availity/app-icon';

<div className="w-100 d-flex flex-row justify-content-around align-items-center">

</AppIcon>
<AppIcon title="Payer Space" color="blue" size="xl">
