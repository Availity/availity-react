[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@availity/authorize.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@availity/authorize)

## Installation

```bash
npm install @availity/authorize @availity/api-axios @availity/api-core axios --save
```

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Authorize from '@availity/authorize';

<Authorize permissions="1234">
  {/* stuff to render if the user is authorized with permission indicated above */}
</Authorize>
```

## Props

### `permissions: string | number | Array<string | number | Array<string | number>>`

Can either be a string, eg: `"1234"`, a number, eg: `1234`, or an array, which can contain permission ID strings/numbers as well as other arrays which contain permission ID strings/numbers, eg: `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]`. The items in a nested array indicate permission IDs that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if _any_ are granted, the user is considered authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` is similar to `'1234' OR '2345' OR ('3456' && '4567') OR ('5678' && '6789')`.

### `resources?: string | number | Array<string | number | Array<string | number>>`

When present, the permission is validated to ensure it contains the resource(s). Can either be a string, eg: `"12345"`, a number, eg: `12345`, or an array, which can contain resource ID strings/numbers as well as other arrays which contain resource ID strings/numbers, eg: `['12345', '23456', ['34567', '45678'], ['56789', '67890']]`. The items in a nested array indicate resource IDs that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if _any_ are granted, the user is considered authorized. The example `['12345', '23456', ['34567', '45678'], ['56789', '67890']]` is similar to `'12345' OR '23456' OR ('34567' && '45678') OR ('56789' && '67890')`.

### `loader?: boolean | ReactNode`

When `true`, `BlockUi` is used when loading the permissions. When a `node`, that node is rendered instead of `BlockUi` when loading the permissions. When `false`, nothing is rendered when loading the permissions. **Default:** `true`.

### `organizationId?: string`

When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.

### `customerId?: string`

When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the customer.

### `region?: string | boolean`

When a string, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the provided region. When true, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the current region. **Default:** `true`.

### `unauthorized?: ReactNode`

The content that renders when the user _does not_ have the permissions required.

### `children: ReactNode`

The content that renders when the user _does_ have the permissions required.

### `negate?: boolean`

Negate the authorization. If the user _does_ have the permissions specified, they are considered "unauthorized" (shown the `unauthorized` prop content). If the user _does not_ have the permissions specified, they are considered "authorized" (shown the `children` prop content)

## useAuthorize

Hook which validates the user's permissions.

Returns `[authorized, loading, currentRegion]`

- `authorized` : Whether the user is authorized to see the content.

- `loading` : Whether the component is loading/checking permissions.

- `currentRegion` : The current region of the user. Useful for avoiding extra API calls if code downstream depends on current region.

### Arguments

- **`permissions`**: String,Number,Array<`String`,`Number`,Array<`String`,`Number`>>. Required.
  - **string/number**: The permission ID, eg: `'1234'` or `1234`
  - **array**: The array can contain permission ID strings/numbers as well as other arrays which contain permission ID strings/numbers, eg: `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]`. The items in a nested array indicate permission IDs that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if _any_ are granted to the user, the user is considered authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` is similar to `'1234' || '2345' || ('3456' && '4567') || ('5678' && '6789')`.
- **`options`** Object. Optional. Additional options
  - **`organizationId`**: String. Optional. When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.
  - **`customerId`**: String. Optional. When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the customer.
  - **`region`**: String or Boolean. Optional. Default: `true`. When a string, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the provided region. When true, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the current region.
  - **`resources`**: String,Number,Array<`String`,`Number`,Array<`String`,`Number`>>. Optional.
    - **string/number**: The resource ID, eg: `'12345'` or `12345`
    - **array**: The array can contain resource ID strings/numbers as well as other arrays which contain resource ID strings/numbers, eg: `['12345', '23456', ['34567', '45678'], ['56789', '67890']]`. The items in a nested array indicate resource IDs that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if _any_ are granted to the user, the user is considered authorized. The example `['12345', '23456', ['34567', '45678'], ['56789', '67890']]` is similar to `'12345' || '23456' || ('34567' && '45678') || ('56789' && '67890')`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
