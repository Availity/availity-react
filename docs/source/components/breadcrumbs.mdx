## Usage and Behavior

### Default Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are used as a navigational component. They are used uniformly in the top left corner of 
portal applications just beneath the application header. They are intended as a way to help the user
better understand where they are logically in the application as well as provide a quick way back to
the previous view they were on.
