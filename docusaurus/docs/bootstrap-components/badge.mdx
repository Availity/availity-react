### `RemovableBadge` Props

`<RemovableBadge/>` contains all of the `BadgeProp` from Reactstrap, in addition to the following.

#### `value: string`

This is a unique value for the badge, which is passed up to the `onRemove` function to describe which badge is being removed.

#### `onRemove: (value: string) => void`

This is the function that is called whenever the 'X' icon is clicked. It passes the value of the specified badge to the parent component.

## Removable Badge List

This component allows you to specify a list of badges and handles removing the badge from the badge list.

### Example

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { RemovableBadgeList, BadgeItem } from '@availity/badge';

const Example = () => {
  const defaultBadgeList: BadgeItem[] = [
    { value: '1', color: 'primary', displayText: 'Test 1' },
    { value: '2', color: 'success', displayText: 'Test 2' },
    { value: '3', color: 'danger', displayText: 'Test 3' },
    { value: '4', color: 'warning', displayText: 'Test 4' },
    { value: '5', color: 'info', displayText: 'Test 5' },
    { value: '6', color: 'light', displayText: 'Test 6' },
    { value: '7', color: 'dark', displayText: 'Test 7' },
    { value: '8', displayText: 'Test 9' },
  ];
  const [badgeList, setBadgeList] = useState<BadgeItem[]>(defaultBadgeList);

  const remove = () => {
    setBadgeList(defaultBadgeList);
  };

  const onRemoveBadge = (badgeList: BadgeItem[]) => {
    setBadgeList(badgeList);
  };

  return <RemovableBadgeList badges={badgeList} onRemove={onRemoveBadge} />;
};
```
