title: useChangePasswordContext
---

If you are using a function component, you can subscribe to the change password context by using this hook.

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useChangePasswordContext } from '@availity/change-password';

const ChangePasswordComponent = () => {
  const {
    loading,
    setLoading,
    error,
    setError,
    success,
    setSuccess,
    submitted,
    setSubmitted,
    resource,
    schema,
    conditions,
    currentPasswordIconRef,
    newPasswordIconRef,
    confirmNewPasswordIconRef,
    currentPasswordVisible,
    setCurrentPasswordVisible,
    newPasswordVisible,
    setNewPasswordVisible,
    confirmNewPasswordVisible,
    setConfirmNewPasswordVisible,
  } = useChangePasswordContext();
};
```

### Context Properties

#### `loading: boolean`

Whether or not the ChangePassword component is in a loading state

#### `setLoading: () => void`

Toggle whether or not the ChangePassword component is in a loading state

#### `error: any`

The error state of the ChangePassword component. The error will appear in a red reactstrap `<Alert/>`

#### `setError: () => void`

Set the error state of the ChangePassword component

#### `success: any`

The success state of the ChangePassword component. The success will appear in a green reactstrap `<Alert/>`

#### `setSuccess: () => void`

Set the success state of the ChangePassword component

#### `submitted: boolean`

Whether the ChangePasswordForm has been submitted.

#### `setSubmitted: () => void`

Set whether the ChangePasswordForm has been submitted

#### `resource: AvApi | AvMicroserviceApi`

The resource used to change the user's password. The `changePassword` method will be called on the resource.

#### `schema: object`

The `yup` schema used to validate the inputs in the ChangePassword Form. The `name`s of the inputs in the form are "currentPassword", "newPassword", and "confirmNewPassword". These `names` should correspond to the keys in your `yup` schema.

#### `conditions?: { message: string, passes: func }[]`

The conditions that must be satisified in order for a password change to be submitted. Note, these are not used to validate the state of the form. They are used to give the user feedback as they type to let them know if their password is valid. The `passes` func is passed an object containing the user's `currentPassword`, `newPassword`, and `confirmNewPassword` as well as whether the input fields have been touched: `currentPasswordTouched`, `newPasswordTouched`, and `confirmNewPasswordTouched`, as well as whether or not the form has been submitted, `submitted`. If the `passes` func returns `true`, a green checkmark icon will be displayed. If the `passes` func returns `false`, a red checkmark icon will be displayed. If the `passes` func returns anything else, an empty circle will be displayed. An example of a condition to verify that a password contains an uppercase letter might be:

```js
{
  message: 'Have an uppercase letter',
  passes: ({ newPassword, newPasswordTouched, submitted }) => {
    if (new RegExp('[A-Z]').test(newPassword)) {
      if (newPasswordTouched) return true;
      return null;
    }
    if (submitted) return false;
    return null;
  }
}
```

#### newPasswordIconRef React.ReactRef
