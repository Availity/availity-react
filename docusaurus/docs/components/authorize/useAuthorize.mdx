title: useAuthorize
---

The `useAuthorize` hook accepts a list of permissions, with optional parameters, and will return whether the user is authorized or not.

This package uses [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) to handle data fetching. This means you must add a [QueryClientProvider](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/QueryClientProvider#_top) to your app if you do not already have one. The default setup should cover most use-cases. However, there are 2 options we recommend looking into in order to determine what is correct for your app. These settings are `refetchOnWindowFocus` and `staleTime`. The first option sets whether the to refetch the query when the window is focused, and the other is the default marker for how long the query is valid.

## Args

- **`permissions`**: (string | string[])[]. Required.
  - **string**: The permission ID, eg: `'1234'`
  - **array**: The array can contain Permission ID's as well as other arrays which contain Permission ID's eg: `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]`. The items in a nested array indicate Permission ID's that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as an `"AND"`. The items in the top of the array act as an `"OR"` - if _any_ are granted to the user, the user is considered authorized. For example, `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` is equivalent to `'1234' || '2345' || ('3456' && '4567') || ('5678' && '6789')`.
- **`options`** Object. Optional. Additional options
  - **`organizationId`**: String. Optional. When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.
  - **`customerId`**: String. Optional. When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the customer.
  - **`region`**: String or Boolean. Optional. Default: `true`. When a string, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the provided region. When true, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the current region.
  - **`resources`**: (string | string[])[]. Optional.
    - **string**: The Resource ID, eg: `'12345'`
    - **array**: The array can contain Resource ID's as well as other arrays which contain Resource ID's eg: `['12345', '23456', ['34567', '45678'], ['56789', '67890']]`. The items in a nested array indicate the Resource ID's that must _all_ be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as an `"AND"`. The items in the top of the array act as an `"OR"` - if _any_ are granted to the user, the user is considered authorized. For example, `['12345', '23456', ['34567', '45678'], ['56789', '67890']]` is equivalent to `'12345' || '23456' || ('34567' && '45678') || ('56789' && '67890')`.

## Return Object

An object with two properties is returned from the call

```ts
type ReturnObject = {
  /* Result of permission check */
  authorized: boolean;
  /* State of the api call */
  isLoading: boolean;
};
```

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useAuthorize } from '@availity/authorize';

const Component = () => {
  const { authorized, isLoading } = useAuthorize(['1234', '5678'], {
    region: 'FL',
  });

  return authorized && <SomeAuthorizedComponent />;
};
```
