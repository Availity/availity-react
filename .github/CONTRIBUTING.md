## Contributing

This monorepo is managed using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) and [nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro). Each package is independently versioned and published to the `npm registry`.

## Installation

Ensure you are running version 14 or 16 of `node` and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#readme) to manage your installation of `node`.

```bash
node --version
npm install -g yarn
```

Install the dependencies with `yarn`. The first install might take a while. All subsequent installs should proceed more quickly.

```bash
yarn install
```

Now we run the `build` command to compile our code to be ready for local development.

```bash
yarn build:components
```

You are now ready to begin development in the repo!

## Security

For additional security, this repository uses the python library detect-secrets from [Yelp](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets). Our pre-push hook assumes that you have this installed on your system and will prevent git pushes if this is not the case. For detailed installation and configuration instructions see Yelp's documentation but hopefully all you will need to do is run

```bash
brew install detect-secrets
```

and you should be able to successfully push a test commit to any git remote and now you are ready to start contributing!

## Local Development

### Storybook

The recommended way to work in the repo is running `Storybook` while you write your code. This will give you an environment to view your changes, and also serves as documentation once deployed.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Unit Tests

All new features should have a unit test added. The unit tests will run when you push your code. If you run the tests on your own the results will be cached. This means subsequent executions of `yarn test` will only run tests against code that has changed.

Currently you cannot run all of the tests in watchmode. You can run watchmode for one package at a time. Here is an example for the `app-icon` packge

```bash
yarn nx test app-icon --watch
```

### Linting

This repo uses [eslint-config-availity](https://github.com/Availity/eslint-config-availity#readme) for linting. Make sure to have linting support in your IDE or run the linting script to make sure your code does not have any errors. You will not be able to commit your code if there are linting errors.

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Adding/Removing a dependency

Managing dependencies in a monorepo is similar to a single package repo. The main difference is the command is longer. We are going to use the `workspace` command from `yarn` to tell `yarn` which package we want updated.

Here is an exmaple of adding `react-query` to the `avatar` package

```bash
yarn workspace @availity/avatar add react-query
```

## Adding a New Package

```bash
yarn new
```

## Commits

The commit messages in this repository are important for two main reasons:

1. The `type` (feat, fix, build, etc) is used to determine how to bump the version when publishing.

2. The commits with types `feat` and `fix` will show up in the `CHANGELOG.md` for the given package.

Commits should use the [Angular Commit Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type). Scope should be one of the un-prefixed names of the packages under `./packages/` or `docusaurus` for the docs. If a commit applies to multiple packages, leave out the scope.

For example, here is what the commit message would like when fixing a null-checking error in the [icon](../packages/icon) package:

```bash
git commit -m "fix(icon): check for null before doing the action"
```

In order to bump a package by a major version you must indicate a `BREAKING CHANGE` in the commit message. Read through the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for more information

```bash
git commit -m "feat(table)!: add new features

BREAKING CHANGE: names of props changed"
```

## Canary Releases

Canary Releases can be used to test changes without impacting the `latest` tag.

The first thing we need to do is create a new version to be tagged. Version bumps are generated off the latest commits to the package. You should commit any changes before running the version and publish commands.

Bump the version using a `preid`. The `preid` is the tag you want to use in order to identify the release. If you want to see what version will be created without actually making the changes, then add the `--dry-run` flag to the end.

```bash
# This will make changes to the package.json, changelog.md, and make a commit
yarn nx version app-icon --releaseAs=prerelease --preid=alpha

# Dry run to make sure changes are correct
yarn nx version app-icon --releaseAs=prerelease --preid=alpha --dry-run
```

Once you have a newly created version it will need to be published to the registry so you or others can use it. First login, and then run the publish command

```sh
# login
yarn npm login --publish

# publish
yarn nx publish:canary app-icon
```
