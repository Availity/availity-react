## Navigating the Storybook

Component stories are grouped similarly to how they are in the documentation

- Hooks
- Components
- Form Components
- Legacy Form Components
- Deprecated
- 3rd Party Recommended Components

Each tab presents slightly different information for the component.

**Canvas** is great for demoing each story for a component with different configuration options for each.

**Docs** allow you to view the code snippets for the story.

Additional component information can be found within the [availity-react docs](https://availity.github.io/availity-react)
